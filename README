RequireJS-Wrapper-Plugin
========================

This plugin for RequireJS will give support to load javascript files that doesn't have support 
to AMD pattern, but declare some global var.

This plugin support RequireJS Optimizer.

Configuration
-------------

It's very simple to configure:

* wrapper
** globals
** deps

globals config collection
-------------------------

In globals you must declare your include path as key and the generated global as value.

Exemple for `underscore`:

~~~
wrapper: {
  globals: {
    'lib/underscore': '_'
  }
}
~~~

dependence config collection
----------------------------

Some libs can have dependencies, like `Backbone`, so this feature is to solve this problem very simple.
Because you are working with libs that don't support AMD pattern, you will need to setup their depences in the
config file.

Exemple for `Backbone`:

~~~
wrapper: {
  globals: {
    'lib/underscore': '_',
    'lib/backbone': 'Backbone'
  },
  deps: {
    'lib/backbone': ['lib/underscore']
  }
}
~~~

Using the require feature
-------------------------

It's very simple, you just need to require your target with plugin wrap, example:

~~~
define(['wrap!underscore'], function( _ ) {
  console.debug(_); // returns underscore content
});
~~~
